## Content

Day 1: Python Basics
* Learn: Variables, data types (int, float, string, list, dictionary).
* Practice: Write simple code using these data types.

Day 2: Control Flow and Loops
* Learn: if, elif, else statements, for and while loops.
* Practice: Create small programs using conditions and loops (e.g., print even numbers).

Day 3: Functions and Modules
* Learn: How to define functions with def, using parameters and return values.
* Practice: Write simple functions, e.g., a function to calculate the area of a circle.

Day 4: Introduction to NumPy
* Learn: What is NumPy, arrays, and vectorized operations.
* Practice: Create arrays with np.array, perform simple operations (addition, multiplication).

Day 5: Introduction to Pandas
* Learn: Pandas Series and DataFrames.
* Practice: Load data from a CSV file into a DataFrame and inspect it.

Day 6: Pandas Data Manipulation
* Learn: Select data, filter rows, and clean data.
* Practice: Filter rows by conditions (e.g., all values greater than 50), handle missing data.

Day 7: Aggregating Data with Pandas
* Learn: Grouping data using groupby() and calculating aggregates.
* Practice: Group data by categories (e.g., sum of sales per region).

Day 8: Data Visualization with Matplotlib
* Learn: Create basic plots (line, bar, histogram) using Matplotlib.
* Practice: Plot data from a DataFrame (e.g., a bar chart of sales by product).

Day 9: Advanced Data Visualization with Seaborn
* Learn: Create more advanced visualizations (box plots, scatter plots) with Seaborn.
* Practice: Use Seaborn to plot relationships in your data (e.g., scatter plot for correlation).

Day 10: Mini Project
* Learn: Apply everything you've learned.
* Practice: Analyze a small dataset (e.g., sales data or weather data), clean, visualize, and draw conclusions.
