# 10-Day .NET Core

## **Day 1: Introduction to .NET Core & C# Basics**
- Overview of .NET Core and the differences from .NET Framework.
- C# syntax, data types, variables, constants, and string interpolation.
- Control flow: `if-else`, loops, methods, exception handling (`try-catch`).
- Introduction to collections: Arrays, Lists, Dictionaries.
- File Handler

## **Day 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in .NET Core**
- Classes, objects, constructors, properties, and methods.
- Inheritance, polymorphism, method overriding, `virtual`/`override`.
- Encapsulation, abstraction, and `static` members.

## **Day 3: Interfaces, Abstract Classes & Access Modifiers**
- Defining and implementing interfaces.
- Abstract classes vs interfaces.
- Access modifiers: `public`, `private`, `protected`, `internal`.

## **Day 4: Delegates, Events & LINQ in .NET Core**
- Understanding delegates and events in .NET Core.
- Introduction to LINQ: `Where`, `Select`, `GroupBy`, etc.
- LINQ queries on collections and databases.

## **Day 5: Exception Handling & Logging in .NET Core**
- Advanced exception handling: Custom exceptions, `try-catch-finally`.
- Logging in .NET Core with `ILogger` and third-party libraries (e.g., Serilog).
- Best practices for error management.

## **Day 6: Collections, Generics & Advanced Data Structures**
- Collections: `List<T>`, `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`, `Queue<T>`, `Stack<T>`.
- Generics in C#: Working with generic methods and classes.
- Immutable collections and their use cases.

## **Day 7: File I/O, Database Access & Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**
- File handling using `System.IO`.
- ADO.NET for database interactions (SQL commands, connections).
- Introduction to Entity Framework Core (EF Core): CRUD operations, migrations.

## **Day 8: Asynchronous Programming & Parallelism in .NET Core**
- Asynchronous programming with `async`/`await`.
- Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP) and `Task.WhenAll`.
- Parallel programming with `Parallel.ForEach` and managing concurrency.

## **Day 9: Dependency Injection, Unit Testing & Web API in .NET Core**
- Dependency Injection (DI) in .NET Core applications.
- Writing unit tests using xUnit or MSTest.
- Building RESTful APIs with ASP.NET Core, including security (JWT, OAuth).

## **Day 10: Advanced .NET Core Topics & Performance Optimization**
- Advanced design patterns: Singleton, Factory, Repository.
- Performance tuning: memory management, garbage collection, profiling.
- Security best practices: encryption, authentication, and authorization in .NET Core.
